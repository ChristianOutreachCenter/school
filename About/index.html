              <h1>About Christian Outreach School</h1>
              <p>
                Christian Outreach School was founded in 1977 in order to
                disciple children from Christian families and help guide them
                into the Lord's unique and significant calling for each of their
                lives. We believe there is a great need for Christ-centered,
                Bible-based education in this area, and our desire is to make it
                available to Christian families who value this kind of
                education, regardless of income level. Our faculty minister
                sacrificially and with the ability and strength God provides.

                After graduating from Valparaiso University with a B.S. in
                elementary education in 1991, Steve Miller taught 3rd and 4th
                grades at COS for ten years, marrying Pastor Nick's daughter
                Cathy along the way. In 2001, the Millers and their two boys
                moved to China to teach English in Guizhou Normal University for
                ten years. On their furlough year in 2006-2007, Steve returned
                with his family, including two blond China-born daughters, to
                COS to teach 5th and 6th grades and P.E. After ten years total
                in China, the Millers again have been unable to resist the call
                of COS. Steve likes to play and watch all kinds of sports, go
                fishing and bow hunting, play guitar and mandolin, run, and
                write. His artistic outlet is decorating birthday cakes to look
                like anything his children, relatives, or esteemed friends
                desire.

                After twenty years of staying home with her family, she decided
                to go back to college and realized her ambition of becoming a
                teacher. She enrolled at Jefferson College and re-discovered the
                joys of algebra at age forty! She knew she did not want to major
                in math. After getting her associate's degree, she made
                arrangements to finish at Fontbonne College in St. Louis. Her
                major was in communication art/theater education with a minor in
                English. She graduated with honors and thought, "Now what?" Her
                plan was to teach drama in her hometown (De Soto). She
                substitute taught for a year, and it became apparent to her that
                teaching at DeSoto Public School was not God's plan. He led her
                (and her children) to Christian Outreach School. As always, He
                knew what was best. All three of her children are successful
                adults now—who continue to walk with Christ—after graduation
                from COS, and her family (herself especially) have been richly
                blessed. Praise the Lord! Now her grandchildren attend COS and
                comes to school with her every morning.

                He met his wife, Mona, there, and they were missionaries in
                Papua, New Guinea for several years. They have home schooled the

                the Saint Louis area. He is interested in family, grand kids,
                missions, politics, classical music, history, and fixing things
                so they work properly. He has been active in Christian Outreach
                Church since 1977, and has been teaching Christian Instruction
                at Christian Outreach School since 2001. With the inception of a
                more classical approach to education at COS, he began teaching
                Modern Greek and Introductory Logic. “Why do I teach at COS?”,
                he asks. "I want our students to excel under the tutelage of the
                Holy Spirit in this God-mocking society we live in today, just
                like Daniel and his companions excelled in their day."

                When Jane was four years old, her family moved to the Goldman,
                MO area so that her father could attend COSM. She attended CODS,
                as it was called at that time, from kindergarten until she
                graduated with the class of '91. Afterward, she attended
                Jefferson College, pursuing a degree in Hotel and Restaurant
                Management. Jefferson County and Christian Outreach has always
                been her home, and now her husband, Daniel, and she are bringing
                up her family here as well. After homeschooling for three years,
                they are thrilled to be able to send their two boys to COS. Jane
                has been learning sign language in order to communicate with her
                daughter who is deaf as a result of contracting meningitis as an
                infant. There was an obvious need for their sons to learn sign
                language as well, and since students were interested in a class,
                Jane began teaching Introduction to Sign Language at COS for the
                2012-2013 school year. The following year, Jane accepted the
                challenge of teaching 1st-3rd grade and Intermediate Sign
                Language. After more than fifteen years of working in hotels or
                food service, she finds herself teaching at COS (a childhood
                dream of hers) and once again feeling a part of the COS family.

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To provide a Christ-centered environment for the pursuit of excellence
          in education To disciple each student to conform to the image of Jesus
          Christ, making Jesus Lord in every life situation. In order to
          accomplish this purpose as we serve Christian families in the greater
          Jefferson county area, we must provide a Christ-centered educational
          program for children and youth (PreK-12th grade) without
          discrimination on the basis of race, gender, national and ethnic
          origin, or physical disability, which adheres to the criteria listed
          below.
        </p>
        <h4>The education we offer must be:</h4>
        <p>
          In accordance with the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments
          of the Bible, the very Word of God, inspired, inerrant, and infallible
          An extension of the Christian home, submitting to the authority of the
          Christian Outreach Church leadership, who, together with the parents,
          are accountable to God for the fulfillment of His injunction to bring
          up our children "in the nurture (training) and admonition
          (discipline/instruction) of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:4) Our vision, for
          which this mission is set forth, is to lead each student to a greater
          and personal commitment to the Lordship of Jesus Christ and to
          encourage each student to maximize his or her God-given potential,
          achieved by pursuing excellence in spiritual growth, academics,
          athletics and physical fitness, fine arts, and vocational arts, that
          each student may give of himself in fruitful service to his community,
          his nation, the Church, and the work of the Kingdom of God world-wide.
